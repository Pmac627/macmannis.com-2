#MacMannis.com - Version 2#
**MacMannis.com - Version 2**. With a much better understanding of how MVC frameworks run under the hood, *MacMannis.com* is being redesigned on the **CodeIgniter 2.1.2** framework. The completed project will include a **HTML5BoilerPlate**-based responsive design, 100% custom blog, resume, code snippit repository and RSS feed.
###Folder Structure###
**apps** -> This is the **CodeIgniter** *application* folder. The site-specific stuff is located in the *controllers*, *models* and *views* folders. *models* and *views* contain a subdirectory setup. Each subdirectory has a corresponding *controller* file. header.php and footer.php are not in a subdiectory because they are utilized by every page. In the future, they will be auto-loaded.  
**ci_core** -> This is the **CodeIgniter** *system* folder.  
**cdn** -> This folder actually will reside on a sub-domain. It contains the JavaScript, CSS, Fonts and Images.
